; Exercise 1.28. One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the Miller-Rabin test (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980).

; This starts from an alternate form of Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem, which states that if n is a prime number and a is any positive integer less than n, then a raised to the (n - 1)st power is congruent to 1 modulo n.

; To test the primality of a number n by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number a<n and raise a to the (n - 1)st power modulo n using the expmod procedure.
(define (miller-rabin-test n)
  (define r (random n))
  (= (expmod r (- n 1) n) 1))

; However, whenever we perform the squaring step in expmod, we check to see if we have discovered a "nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n," that is, a number not equal to 1 or n - 1 whose square is equal to 1 modulo n. It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of 1 exists, then n is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if n is an odd number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers a<n, computing a n-1 in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n. (This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.)
(define (square-test x n)
  (cond ((and
          (not (= x 1))
          (not (= x (- n 1)))
          (= (remainder (* x x) n) 1)) 0)
        (else (* x x))))

; Modify the expmod procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to fermat-test. Check your procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient way to make expmod signal is to have it return 0.
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder (square-test (expmod base (/ exp 2) m) m)
                    m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                    m))))
