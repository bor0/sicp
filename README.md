In this repository I will be adding my solutions to the SICP exercises.

I decided to give SICP a try. SICP definitely assumes some programming experience and is not as user friendly as other books.

Once the reader has gained some basic programming skills, SICP will advance them to a higher level of programming.

As for functional programming, I have some experience with Haskell (given basic, intermediate, and expert, I am probably at the upper half between basic and intermediate), and SICP goes well but occasionally I get stuck on some of the exercises.

Things I recommend to read before SICP:
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus
2. http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262560992
3. http://www.amazon.com/dp/1593272839
4. http://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X

The reader is also assumed to have some experience with writing mathematical proofs, as well as designing algorithms. To the books above I additionally recommend http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521675995. The first few chapters should be sufficient.

On my computer I am using Racket-lang, and on my phone I am using Scheme Droid.

I plan to use the book as follows:
1. Skim through the given section
2. Go back, and read it in details
3. Do the exercises
4. Watch http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/ to get re-motivated
